Disaster recovery is one of the key concepts in the cloud computing envoronment. RTO (Recovery Time Objective) and RPO (Recover Point Objective) are the two important metrics that help us to choose right Disaster Recovery strategy.RPO is the maximum targeted time period after which data will be lost due to an incident while RTO is the targeted time period after which a business process recovers. In our example we have a Read Replica of the DB in another AZ thus when your primary instance fails, you failover to the secondary instance (in our case Read Replica) with no data loss.RDS with Read replicas often provide 1-10 seconds of RPO and ~ 2- 5 mts of RTO.
